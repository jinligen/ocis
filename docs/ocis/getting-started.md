## Run oCIS

We are distributing oCIS as binaries and Docker images.

You can find more deployments examples in the [deployment section](https://owncloud.github.io/ocis/deployment/)

### Binaries

The binaries for different platforms are downloadable at [our download mirror](https://download.owncloud.com/ocis/ocis/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/releases). Latest binaries from the master branch can be found at [our download mirrors testing section](https://download.owncloud.com/ocis/ocis/testing/).

```console
# for mac
curl https://download.owncloud.com/ocis/ocis/testing/ocis-testing-darwin-amd64 --output ocis
# for linux
curl https://download.owncloud.com/ocis/ocis/testing/ocis-testing-linux-amd64 --output ocis
# make binary executable
chmod +x ocis
./ocis server
```

The default primary storage location is `./data/`. You can change that value by configuration.


### Docker

Docker images for oCIS are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/owncloud/ocis).

The `latest` tag always reflects the current master branch.

```console
docker pull owncloud/ocis
docker run --rm -ti -p 9200:9200 owncloud/ocis
```

### Basic Management Commands

The oCIS single binary contains multiple extensions and the `ocis` command helps you to manage them. You already used `ocis server` to run all available extensions in the [Run oCIS]({{< relref "#run-ocis" >}}) section. We now will show you some more management commands, which you may also explore by typing `ocis --help` or going to the [docs]({{< relref "configuration.md" >}}).

To start oCIS server:

{{< highlight txt >}}
ocis server
{{< / highlight >}}

The list command prints all running oCIS extensions.
{{< highlight txt >}}
ocis list
{{< / highlight >}}

To stop a particular extension:
{{< highlight txt >}}
ocis server kill web
{{< / highlight >}}

To start a particular extension:
{{< highlight txt >}}
ocis server run web
{{< / highlight >}}

The version command prints the version of your installed oCIS.
{{< highlight txt >}}
ocis --version
{{< / highlight >}}

The health command is used to execute a health check, if the exit code equals zero the service should be up and running, if the exist code is greater than zero the service is not in a healthy state. Generally this command is used within our Docker containers, it could also be used within Kubernetes.
